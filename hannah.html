		<h2>the Past.</h2>
		<p>A Charlotte, NC native, Hannah believes herself to have been a city girl in a past life. She thanks her grandparents for this, who spent many years in Brooklyn, NY. She is the middle child of 3, with 17 first cousins on her mom's side. In college she studied Architecture, though her real experiments took place in her kitchen.</p>
	</div>	

	<div class="middle">
		<h2>the Present.</h2>
		<p>Hannah cooks vegan fare for fun, while studying code on the the side. Learning is her favorite past-time, so she can often be found reading a book on languages of the spoken and IT variety, or watching a documentary about how to change the world.</p>
	</div>

	<div class="right">
		<h2>the Future.</h2>
		<p>Hannah has no other plans but to save the world. She hopes to use code and food to do so.</p>
